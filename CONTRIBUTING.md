#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Check the [issues](https://github.com/your-username/drizzle-transactional/issues) for a list of current known issues.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Drizzle Transactional? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/your-username/drizzle-transactional/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-username/drizzle-transactional/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Drizzle Transactional's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Drizzle Transactional
- Enable a sustainable system for Drizzle Transactional's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
